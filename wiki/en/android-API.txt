! Android Scripting

Unity Android provides a number of scripting APIs unified with iOS APIs to access handheld device functionality. For cross-platform projects, UNITY_ANDROID is defined for conditionally compiling Android-specific C# code. The following scripting classes contain Android-related changes (some of the API is shared between Android and iOS):
||[[ScriptRef:Input.html | Input]] ||Access to multi-touch screen, accelerometer and device orientation.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneSettings.html | iPhoneSettings]] ||Some of the Android settings, such as screen orientation, dimming and information about device hardware.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneKeyboard.html | iPhoneKeyboard]] ||Support for native on-screen keyboard.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneUtils.html | iPhoneUtils]] ||Useful functions for movie playback, anti-piracy protection and vibration.
